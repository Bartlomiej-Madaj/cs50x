Ad. 1. The average energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from the past year are 0.66, 0.48, 0.72, which indicates that the given song list provides more positive than negative auditory impressions.

Ad. 2. Because it is an average value. In my opinion, a better way could be sorting the energy, valence, and danceability values from highest to lowest and comparing those values for each song.
