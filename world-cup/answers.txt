Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With an increase in the number of simulations, the chance of Portugal winning increases.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: That depends on the amount of the fee.
